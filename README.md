# Project 3


### Aim:
to build a MERN stack app

### Technologies used:
* HTML5
* SCSS
* Javascript
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* Express.js
* React
* Git
* Github
* Webpack
* Heroku
* Bulma


### The site:
The site is a blogging platform with a multilingual twist. Users can post in a variety of languages, and other users are then able to translate the post. In this way users can access content they may otherwise have been unable to, and can benefit from different cultural perspectives. In terms of technical requirements, the site uses an Express API from a Mongo database and uses React on the front end. The articles model has CRUD functionality.


### The process:
The first step was to consider the possible users of the app. The most likely market would be bilingual, as although it is a blogging platform, the USP is the possibility of translating blog posts.  

There are a number of features which could be included in this type of app, but for the MVP I decided to focus on a basic product which would allow users to add, edit and delete posts and translations of those posts. The first step was to consider the personas and how they might interact with the site. As a result of this, I realised the site navigation needed to use as few words as possible, on the basis that some users wouldn't be English speakers. However, this did cause some problems as I was able to design things that I'm not yet able to recreate with code.
I also outlined the structure of my files and the details I would require in my model.
